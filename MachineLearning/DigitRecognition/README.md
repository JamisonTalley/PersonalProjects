# DigitRecognition.py
This is an implementation of a convolutional neural network using PyTorch that can identify handwritten digits. This model trains on the 2D MNIST (handwritten digit) dataset, and achieves a test set accuracy of over 98% in only two epochs of training.

This network takes advantage of fully-connected layers, convolutional layers, max pooling, and batch normalization to achieve higher performance with lower training time.
