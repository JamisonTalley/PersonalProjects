This program is a text based rock/paper/scissors game
Note the 'cpu' for this program does not rely on purely random
methods to decide upon a move. The strategy is based on standard
rock/paper/scissors theory, and thus is expected to have a greater
than 50% chance at winning in the long run when playing against an
average human.
