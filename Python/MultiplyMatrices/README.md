the goal of this program is to multiply (if possible)
two matrices given by the user. Being as matrix multiplication
is only possible of rectangular matrices where the number of 
collumns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the
second matrix, we need to be very careful about the formatting
of our data structure.
the value of this excercise is in designing a lightweight,
functional data structure to solve a specific problem
