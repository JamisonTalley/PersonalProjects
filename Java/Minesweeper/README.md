The goal of this program is to generate a field
of mines in accordance with the structure of the
game "Minesweeper". This is meant to serve as an
introduction to the game of minesweeper for a beginner
to better understand the structure of the game, as
mines are exposed by default

the challenge I set for this program was to write
entirely non-branching and optomized code. The primary
purpose behind this goal is performance, as non branching
code with linear performace optomization runs much faster.
An unfortunate side effect of this, however, is a decrease
in readability. To combat this, I included detailed 
documentation for this program, but basic knowledge of
non-branching code structures in Java will be necessary
to follow this program.
