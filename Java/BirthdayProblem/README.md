The purpose of this program is to create a simulation
of 'The Birthday Problem'. This specific thought and
math experiment examines the question: How many people
need to enter a room until there are two people with the
same birthday in the room.
An interesting question that follows this premise is:
"What if we only let people in the room who were born
in January?" From here we have the basis for our program:
we take a command line argument of how many birthdays we
will consider as valid (366, for example, if we want to
allow for any birthday including feb 29), and another
command line argument to determine how many iterations
of our simulation we want to run.
We then run our program and print the distribution of
our results.
