# Personal Projects

### About
This is where I publish a selection of my personal coding projects. These are primarily written in Python and Java, but I use several other languages in my commercial and collaborative projects (JavaScript, C, Swift, etc). Check out my LinkedIn to learn more.

### Recommendations
Below are a few of my favorite projects in this repository:
- A Wordle solving algorithm in Java that won 1st place in a coding competition at the University of Montana:
    - [Algorithms/Wordle](https://github.com/JamisonTalley/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Algorithms/Wordle)
- An interactive navigation program in Python that visually demonstrates how different graph searching algorithms work:
    - [Algorithms/GraphSearching](https://github.com/JamisonTalley/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Algorithms/GraphSearching)
- A ground-up implementation of stochastic gradient descent for neural networks in Python using only NumPy. 
    - [MachineLearning/GroundUpSGD](https://github.com/JamisonTalley/PersonalProjects/tree/main/MachineLearning/GroundUpSGD)
- A convolutional neural network for handwritten digit recognition using PyTorch.
    - [MachineLearning/DigitRecognition](https://github.com/JamisonTalley/PersonalProjects/tree/main/MachineLearning/DigitRecognition)
